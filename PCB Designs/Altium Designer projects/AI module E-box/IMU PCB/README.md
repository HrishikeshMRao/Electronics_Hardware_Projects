IMU pcb holds a BNO055 AND BNO010 for arm and AI mission respectively hence it is provided with the option to power them either through the mother board or drirectly through a micro usb. It mounts over the motherboard that provides 5V to the arm's IMU. BNO055 communicates with arduino nano during the entire AI mission through I2C protocol while BNO010 communicates with the module ESP always.
