Science Module consists of 10 Custom relay blocks each 12V rated. It takes 5V and 12V as inputs from the power distribution board above it. It houses an ESP32 that controls the peristaltic pumps through the relays and 3 motor drivers on the board for the opertaion of the Scince module. Its is CAN enabled aswell as has separate fuse and overvoltage protection for the microcontroller and the stepper driver that controls the movement of the science tray.
