The central PCB, powered by ESP32, manages drive system control and communicates with the base station in conjunction with the communication PCB. The module child board oversees rover modules like the Robotic Manipulator or Science module. The Rover IMU PCB hosts the rover's Inertial Measurement Unit for hill assist, collaborating with the GPS for precise rover positioning. Module boards are adaptable for specific requirements and future enhancements. Communication between the Central and Module ESP32 utilises the UART protocol.
