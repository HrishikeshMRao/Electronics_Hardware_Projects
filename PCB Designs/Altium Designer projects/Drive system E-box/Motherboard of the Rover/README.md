Definitly the most complex design i ever designed. 4 layer high density board. took me 4 days straight for routing alone. It is the bus of the entire rover, connects different child boards doing their specific tasks together to create a fast communication network. It mounts on the Power distribution board and takes 12V and 5V as input. Houses 7 Cytron MD13s motordrivers each with fuse protection. Beast of a unit.
