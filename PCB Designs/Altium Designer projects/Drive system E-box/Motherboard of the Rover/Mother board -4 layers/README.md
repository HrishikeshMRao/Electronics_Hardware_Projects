The Electronics Box of the rover incorporates an upgraded PCB system, built upon the foundation of last year's design with a focus on modularity and future expandability. The four-layered motherboard serves as the core, accommodating motor drivers for both the drive system, robotic arm and science module. Notably, the motherboard can host up to eight customizable child boards, allowing adaptability for diverse mission requirements.
At the heart of the motherboard is a central child board housing the ESP32 microcontroller, acting as the rover's main control unit. This microcontroller manages the drive system, along with various essential peripherals. Moreover, the motherboard features the flexibility to integrate an additional ESP32 module, tailored to mission-specific requirements.
Specialised child boards have been crafted to handle specific functions within the system.
