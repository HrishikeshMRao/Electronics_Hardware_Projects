The rover is powered by four 6C (22.2V) Li-Po battery packs. This power is directed to our robust custom Power Distribution Board (PDB). The PDB incorporates buck converters to generate 15V, 12V, and 5V outputs, supplying power to various rover peripherals. In case of an emergency, a kill switch has been incorporated to promptly halt all rover functions. The PDB is neatly stacked with the Motherboard for optimal space utilisation.
