# LTSpice
LTSpice had an easy beginner friendly user interface. I could only work on two drafts before switching my attention to Proteus. Projects were pretty basic i.e. CMOS and Bipolar transistors as a switch and thier responceses to pulsed signals. Draft 1 plots the potential difference across an led while Draft 2 explores all the possibilities using NMOS,PMOS,NPN,PNP transistors and how CMOS technology differs in output compared to BJTs in a pulsed DC circuit.
