# Proteus
One of the most powerful simulation software in the market but it felt a lot less beginner friendly in its interface. 

* I built an half bridge motor driver using an IR2104 IC and LM5101 IC to control motor's speed.
* Worked on building different logic gates using BJTs (This was right after my draft 2 in LTSPICE)
* Built a Pulse width modulator circuit using a 555Timer IC NE555 in its Astable mode which can be used to control motor speeds.
* Finally built a full bridge driver locked antiphase mode using an  HIP4081A IC to control both the speed and the direction of a motor.
